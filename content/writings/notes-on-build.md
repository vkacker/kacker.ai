Tony Fadell's *"Build"* is a book about engineering management, but it's really a book about how to think about building things that matter.

## The Why Before the How

Before you build anything, you need to answer: **why does this exist?** Not why you want to build it, but why the world needs it.

> "Most products fail because they start with 'how' instead of 'why.'" — Tony Fadell

They focus on the technical solution before understanding the problem.

## Solve the Right Problem

Engineers love elegant solutions. But an elegant solution to the wrong problem is still the wrong outcome. Fadell emphasizes:

- Spending time with *users*
- Understanding their **actual pain**
- Not the pain you imagine they have

---

## Decisions Have Momentum

Every early decision cascades. The tech stack you choose, the team you hire, the features you prioritize—they all compound.

> "Think about decisions in terms of their long-term implications, not just short-term ease."

---

## Craftsmanship Matters

You can ship something that works, or you can ship something you're proud of. The difference shows.

Fadell writes about the iPod's scroll wheel, how the tactile feel was carefully designed. **That attention to detail**, even when most users wouldn't notice, is what separates good products from great ones.

## Feedback Loops

> "Build, measure, learn—but make sure you're measuring the right things."

Vanity metrics feel good but don't help you improve. Find the signals in the noise.

*The book is worth reading for the stories alone—building the iPod, founding Nest, his time at Apple. But the framework for thinking about building is the real value.*
