There's a **quiet revolution** happening in American technology. A return to building things you can touch.

> American Dynamism: The belief that America can and should build more of the future.

For the past two decades, software ate the world. We built apps, platforms, and services that transformed how we live. But much of that was rearranging existing value—optimizing distribution, capturing attention, intermediating transactions.

## Why This Matters

American Dynamism is something different. It's about building new capabilities in the physical world:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Manufacturing** | Advanced factories, robotics |
| **Biotech** | New treatments, medical devices |
| **Aerospace** | Space exploration, hypersonic flight |
| **Energy** | Nuclear, grid infrastructure |

These are hard problems with long time horizons and high capital requirements.

### 1. Software Has Limits

Software alone can't solve all problems:

- **Climate change** requires new energy systems
- **Housing affordability** requires new construction methods
- **Healthcare** requires new treatments and delivery mechanisms

*These things need to be built, tested, deployed in the real world.*

---

### 2. Compounding Advantages

There's a compounding advantage in physical capabilities:

> A manufacturing process that works in a lab and a manufacturing process that works at scale are different things.

The gap between them is where **real moats** are built.

### 3. Jobs That Can't Be Outsourced

You can't 3D print a house from Bangalore. You need:

- Skilled workers
- Local supply chains
- Physical infrastructure

---

## The Skeptics Are Right...

These businesses are harder to build than software companies:

- Capital intensive
- Heavily regulated
- Slow to iterate

*But that's precisely why they're valuable.*

---

We're seeing a generation of founders who want to build things. Not just apps that sit on top of other apps, but **fundamental capabilities that expand what's possible**.

> That's worth being optimistic about.
